Foundations of Python Programming

The goal of this book is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python. At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.

Understand computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking. Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed, they transform input data into outputdata.

Writing computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but create problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately.
